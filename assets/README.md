# Daily_planner
Daily Planner excercise

For this project we were tasked with creating a daily planner.  I made a series of columns with text area input fields that would save to local storage when the button was clicked.  I also made a loop to change the color of the fields depending on the time. I learned a lot about how time works with javascript and discovered moment.js which can save a lot of time working on displaying time through javascript.
